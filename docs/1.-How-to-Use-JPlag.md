JPlag can be used via the Command Line Interface (CLI) or programmatically via the Java API.

## Using JPlag via the CLI
JPlag can be used via the Command Line Interface by executing the JAR file.

Example: `java -jar jplag.jar path/to/the/submissions`

The language can either be set with the -l parameter or as a subcommand. If both a subcommand and the -l option are specified, the subcommand will take priority.
When using the subcommand language specific arguments can be set.
A list of language specific options can be obtained by requesting the help page of a subcommand (e.g. "jplag java -h").

The following arguments can be used to control JPlag:
```
Usage: jplag [OPTIONS] [root-dirs[,root-dirs...]...] [COMMAND]

      [root-dirs[,root-dirs...]...]
                       Root-directory with submissions to check for plagiarism

      -bc, --bc, --base-code=<baseCode>
                       Path of  the  directory  containing  the  base  code
                         (common  framework  used  in  all submissions)

      -h, --help           display this help and exit
      -l, --language=<language>
                       Select the language to parse the submissions (default:
                         java). The language names are the same as the
                         subcommands.

      -n, --shown-comparisons=<shownComparisons>
                       The maximum number of comparisons that will  be  shown
                         in the generated report, if set to -1 all comparisons
                         will be shown (default: 100)

      -new, --new=<newDirectories>[,<newDirectories>...]
                       Root-directory with submissions to check for plagiarism
                         (same as the root directory)

      -old, --old=<oldDirectories>[,<oldDirectories>...]
                       Root-directory with prior submissions to compare against

      -r, --result-directory=<resultFolder>
                       Name of the directory in which the comparison results
                         will be stored (default: result)

      -t, --min-tokens=<minTokenMatch>
                       Tunes the comparison sensitivity by adjusting the
                         minimum token required to be counted as a matching
                         section. A smaller <n>  increases  the sensitivity but
                         might lead to more false-positives

Advanced
      -d, --debug          Debug parser. Non-parsable files will be stored
                         (default: false)

      -m, --similarity-threshold=<similarityThreshold>
                       Comparison similarity threshold [0.0-1.0]:  All
                         comparisons  above this threshold will be saved
                         (default: 0.0)

      -p, --suffixes=<suffixes>[,<suffixes>...]
                       comma-separated list of all filename suffixes that are
                         included

      -s, --subdirectory=<subdirectory>
                       Look in directories <root-dir>/*/<dir> for programs

      -x, --exclusion-file=<exclusionFileName>
                       All files named in this file will be ignored in the
                         comparison (line-separated list)
      
      --normalize      (Java only) Enable token string normalization,
                         which can help detect certain cases of plagiarism.

Clustering
      --cluster-alg, --cluster-algorithm=<algorithm>
                       Which clustering algorithm to use. Agglomerative  merges
                         similar submissions bottom up. Spectral clustering is
                         combined  with  Bayesian  Optimization  to  execute
                         the k-Means clustering  algorithm  multiple   times,
                         hopefully   finding   a   "good"  clustering
                         automatically. (default: spectral)

      --cluster-metric=<metric>
                       The metric used for clustering. AVG  is  intersection
                         over  union, MAX can expose some attempts of
                         obfuscation. (default: MAX)

      --cluster-skip   Skips the clustering (default: false)

*Note that the [legacy CLI](https://github.com/jplag/jplag/blob/legacy/README.md) is varying slightly.*

## Using JPlag programmatically
The new API makes it easy to integrate JPlag's plagiarism detection into external Java projects.

**Example:**

```java
Language language = new de.jplag.java.Language();
language.getOptions(); //Use this to set language specific options, same as language specific arguments above.
Set<File> submissionDirectories = Set.of(new File("/path/to/rootDir"));
File baseCode = new File("/path/to/baseCode");
JPlagOptions options = new JPlagOptions(language, submissionDirectories, Set.of()).withBaseCodeSubmissionDirectory(baseCode);

try {
    JPlagResult result = JPlag.run(options);
     
    // Optional
    ReportObjectFactory reportObjectFactory = new ReportObjectFactory();
    reportObjectFactory.createAndSaveReport(result, "/path/to/output");
} catch (ExitException e) {
    // error handling here
}
```

## Report File Generation

After a JPlag run a zipped result report is automatically created.
The target location of the report can be specified with the `-r` flag.

If the `-r` is not specified, the location defaults `result.zip`. Specifying the `-r` flag with a path `/path/to/desiredFolder` results in the report being created as `/path/to/desiredFolder.zip`.

Unless there is an error during the zipping process, the report will always be zipped. If the zipping process fails, the report will be available as unzipped under the specified location.

## Viewing Reports

The newest version of the report viewer is always accessible at https://jplag.github.io/JPlag/. Simply drop your `result.zip` folder on the page to start inspecting the results of your JPlag run. Your submissions will neither be uploaded to a server nor stored permanently. They are saved in the application as long as you view them. Once you refresh the page, all information will be erased.


## Basic Concepts

This section explains some fundamental concepts about JPlag that make it easier to understand and use.

* **Root directory:** This is the directory in which JPlag will scan for submissions.
* **Submissions:** Submissions contain the source code that JPlag will parse and compare. They have to be direct children of the root directory and can either be single files or directories.

### Single-file submissions

```
/path/to/root-directory
├── Submission-1.java
├── ...
└── Submission-n.java
```

### Directory submissions

JPlag will read submission directories recursively, so they can contain multiple (nested) source code files.

```
/path/to/root-directory
├── Submission-1
│   ├── Main.java
│   └── util
│       └── Utils.java
├── ...
└── Submission-n
    ├── Main.java
    └── util
        └── Utils.java
```

If you want JPlag to scan only one specific subdirectory of the submissions for source code files (e.g. `src`), can configure that with the argument `-S`:

```
/path/to/root-directory
├── Submission-1
│   ├── src                 
│   │   ├── Main.java       # Included
│   │   └── util            
│   │       └── Utils.java  # Included
│   ├── lib                 
│   │   └── Library.java    # Ignored
│   └── Other.java          # Ignored
└── ...
```


### Base Code

The base code is a special kind of submission. It is the template that all other submissions are based on. JPlag will ignore all matches between two submissions, where the matches are also part of the base code. Like any other submission, the base code has to be a single file or directory in the root directory.

```
/path/to/root-directory
├── BaseCode
│   └── Solution.java
├── Submission-1
│   └── Solution.java
├── ...
└── Submission-n
    └── Solution.java
```

In this example, students have to solve a given problem by implementing the `run` method in the template below. Because they are not supposed to modify the `main` function, it will be identical for each student. 

```java
// BaseCode/Solution.java
public class Solution {

    // DO NOT MODIFY
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();  
        solution.run();
    }
    
    public void run() {
        // TODO: Implement your solution here.
    }
}
```

To prevent JPlag from detecting similarities in the `main` function (and other parts of the template), we can instruct JPlag to ignore matches with the given base code by providing the `--bc=<base-code-name>` option. 
The `<base-code-name>` in the example above is `BaseCode`.

### Multiple Root Directories
* You can run JPlag with multiple root directories, JPlag compares submissions from all of them
* JPlag distinguishes between old and new root directories
** Submissions in new root directories are checked amongst themselves and against submissions from other root directories
** Submissions in old root directories are only checked against submissions from other new root directories
* You need at least one new root directory to run JPlag

This allows you to check submissions against those of previous years:
```
/path/to/root-new
└── ...
/path/to/root-old1
└── ...
/path/to/root-old2
└── ...
```
