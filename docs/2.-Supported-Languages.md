JPlag currently supports Java, C, C++, C#, Go, Kotlin, Python, R, Rust, Scala, Swift, and Scheme. Additionally, it has primitive support for text and prototypical support for EMF metamodels. A detailed list, including the supported language versions can be found in the [project readme](https://github.com/jplag/JPlag/blob/main/README.md#supported-languages).

The language modules differ in their maturity due to their age and different usage frequencies.
Thus, each frontend has a state label:
- `mature`: This module is tried and tested, as well as up to date with a current language version.
- `beta`: This module is relatively new and up to date. However, it is not as well tested. **Feedback welcome!**
- `alpha`: This module is very new and not yet finished. Use with caution! 
- `legacy`: This module is from JPlag legacy (pre-v3.0.0) and may only support outdated language versions. It needs an update.
- `unknown`: It is very much unclear in which state this module is.

All language modules can be found [here](https://github.com/jplag/JPlag/tree/master/languages).
